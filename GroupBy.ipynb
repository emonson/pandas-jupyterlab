    "Our data often consists of individual observations or events. To make sense of the patterns in the data it can be helpful to aggregate the data within categorical groups. The general method is described as the Split-Apply-Combine strategy for data analysis, as described in [this classic paper by Hadley Wickham](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01/v40i01.pdf).\n",

    "- **Transformation**: perform some group-specific computations and return a like-indexed object, such as a standardize data (zscore) within a group, or filling NAs within groups with a value derived from each group\n",
    "- **Filtration**: discard some groups, according to a group-wise computation that evaluates True or False, such as discarding data that belongs to groups with only a few members, or filtering out data based on the group sum or mean\n"
